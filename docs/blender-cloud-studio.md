# Cloud Blender candidate studio — dish

This workflow can be triggered from an iPhone using GitHub's **Actions → Blender candidate art studio (manual review) → Run workflow**, once GitHub Actions capacity is available. It creates an original Blender scene and exports a GLB as an **unapproved review pack**. It installs Blender on an isolated hosted runner; there is no local computer or paid model provider requirement.

Workflow: `.github/workflows/blender-candidate.yml`. Blender source: `scripts/author-blender-candidate.py`.

The output artifact includes **.blend** (editable source), **.glb** (web format) and **.json** (Blender version, hash and provenance). This script uses original procedural primitives and authored materials, not someone else's artwork or third-party assets. It does not access API keys or external models.

The runner checks the GLB with the existing 8 MiB and 160,000-position limits. Passing these checks does **not** establish a good appearance, visual fidelity, browser animation playback, performance or license clearance for any later external inputs.

**No automatic release.** Nothing in this pipeline pushes, deploys, merges, overwrites existing assets or changes the pet/recipe UI. A reviewer must verify actual output, test iOS/desktop WebGL and approve the appearance before any candidate is adopted. Existing original artwork and fallback scenes remain authoritative.

**Current limitation:** Blender is not installed in this ChatGPT session and monthly GitHub Actions credits are exhausted. These scripts have not been executed in a real Blender runtime. The workflow will only produce actual Blender-authored files when a hosted run succeeds, and downloading the artifact from GitHub requires the usual access to this private repository.

## Private iPhone candidate review

Download the GitHub Actions review artifact to Files on iPhone, open the app’s same-origin `/3d-preview.html` page, and choose **Review candidate**. The browser reads the selected `.glb` directly with the File API (8 MiB limit), checks GLB structure, and can play embedded linear animation tracks. Nothing is uploaded. You can use orbit, pinch, pause, and Save PNG locally. The existing static/animated selector restores the repository models. A candidate remains unapproved; this is not a deployment, a Blender render from this ChatGPT session, or real-device QA.
